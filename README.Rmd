In cheapr, 'cheap' means fast and memory-efficient, and that's exactly
the philosophy that cheapr aims to follow.

## Installation

You can install cheapr like so: 

``` r
install.packages("cheapr")
```

or you can install the development version of cheapr:

``` r
remotes::install_github("NicChr/cheapr")
```

Some common operations that cheapr can do much faster and more efficiently include: 

* Counting, finding, removing and replacing `NA` and scalar values

* Creating factors

* Creating multiple sequences in a vectorised way

* Sub-setting vectors and data frames efficiently

* Safe, flexible and fast greatest common divisor and lowest common multiple

* Lags/leads

* Lightweight `integer64` support

* In-memory Math (no copies, vectors updated by reference)

* Summary statistics of data frame variables

* Binning of continuous data

Let's first load the required packages

```{r}
library(cheapr)
library(bench)
```

`num_na()` is a useful function to efficiently return the number of `NA`
values and can be used in a variety of problems.

Almost all the `NA` handling functions in cheapr can make use of multiple cores
on your machine through openMP.

```{r}
x <- rep(NA, 10^6)

# 1 core by default
mark(num_na(x), sum(is.na(x)))
# 4 cores
options(cheapr.cores = 4)
mark(num_na(x), sum(is.na(x)))
options(cheapr.cores = 4)
```

## Efficient NA counts by row/col

```{r}
m <- matrix(x, ncol = 10^3)
# Number of NA values by row
mark(row_na_counts(m), 
     rowSums(is.na(m)))
# Number of NA values by col
mark(col_na_counts(m), 
     colSums(is.na(m)))
```

`is_na` is a multi-threaded alternative to `is.na`

```{r}
x <- rnorm(10^6)
x[sample.int(10^6, 10^5)] <- NA
mark(is.na(x), is_na(x))

### posixlt method is much faster
hours <- as.POSIXlt(seq.int(0, length.out = 10^6, by = 3600),
                    tz = "UTC")
hours[sample.int(10^6, 10^5)] <- NA

mark(is.na(hours), is_na(hours))
```

It differs in 2 regards:

-   List elements are regarded as `NA` when either that element is an
    `NA` value or it is a list containing only `NA` values.
-   For data frames, `is_na` returns a logical vector where `TRUE`
    defines an empty row of only `NA` values.

```{r}
# List example
is.na(list(NA, list(NA, NA), 10))
is_na(list(NA, list(NA, NA), 10))

# Data frame example
df <- data.frame(x = c(1, NA, 3),
                 y = c(NA, NA, NA))
df
is_na(df)
is_na(df)
# The below identity should hold
identical(is_na(df), row_na_counts(df) == ncol(df))
```

`is_na` and all the `NA` handling functions fall back on calling
`is.na()` if no suitable method is found. This means that custom objects
like vctrs rcrds and more are supported.

## Cheap data frame summaries with `overview`

Inspired by the excellent skimr package, `overview()` is a cheaper
alternative designed for larger data.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  x = sample.int(100, 10^7, TRUE),
  y = factor_(sample(LETTERS, 10^7, TRUE)),
  z = rnorm(10^7)
)
overview(df, hist = TRUE)
mark(overview(df))
```

## Cheaper and consistent subsetting with `sset`

```{r}
sset(iris, 1:5)
sset(iris, 1:5, j = "Species")

# sset always returns a data frame when input is a data frame

sset(iris, 1, 1) # data frame
iris[1, 1] # not a data frame

x <- sample.int(10^6, 10^4, TRUE)
y <- sample.int(10^6, 10^4, TRUE)
mark(sset(x, x %in_% y), sset(x, x %in% y), x[x %in% y])
```

`sset` uses an internal range-based subset when `i` is an ALTREP integer
sequence of the form m:n.

```{r}
mark(sset(df, 0:10^5), df[0:10^5, , drop = FALSE])
```

It also accepts negative indexes

```{r}
mark(sset(df, -10^4:0), 
     df[-10^4:0, , drop = FALSE],
     check = FALSE) # The only difference is the row names
```

The biggest difference between `sset` and `[` is the way logical vectors
are handled. The two main differences when `i` is a logical vector are:

-   `NA` values are ignored, only the locations of `TRUE` values are
    used.
-   `i` must be the same length as `x` and is not recycled.

```{r,error=TRUE}
# Examples with NAs
x <- c(1, 5, NA, NA, -5)
x[x > 0]
sset(x, x > 0)

# Example with length(i) < length(x)
sset(x, TRUE)

# This is equivalent 
x[TRUE]
# to..
sset(x)
```

## Vector and data frame lags with `lag_()`

```{r}
set.seed(37)
lag_(1:10, 3) # Lag(3)
lag_(1:10, -3) # Lead(3)

# Using an example from data.table
library(data.table)
dt <- data.table(year=2010:2014, v1=runif(5), v2=1:5, v3=letters[1:5])

# Similar to data.table::shift()

lag_(dt, 1) # Lag 
lag_(dt, -1) # Lead
```

With `lag_` we can update variables by reference, including entire data
frames

```{r}
# At the moment, shift() cannot do this
lag_(dt, set = TRUE)

dt # Was updated by reference
```

`lag2_` is a more generalised variant that supports vectors of lags,
custom ordering and run lengths.

```{r}
lag2_(dt, order = 5:1) # Reverse order lag (same as lead)
lag2_(dt, -1) # Same as above
lag2_(dt, c(1, -1)) # Alternating lead/lag
lag2_(dt, c(-1, 0, 0, 0, 0)) # Lead e.g. only first row
```

## Greatest common divisor and smallest common multiple

```{r}
gcd2(5, 25)
scm2(5, 6)

gcd(seq(5, 25, by = 5))
scm(seq(5, 25, by = 5))

x <- seq(1L, 1000000L, 1L)
mark(gcd(x))
x <- seq(0, 10^6, 0.5)
mark(gcd(x))
```

## Creating many sequences

As an example, to create 3 sequences with different increments,\
the usual approach might be to use lapply to loop through the increment
values together with `seq()`

```{r}
# Base R
increments <- c(1, 0.5, 0.1)
start <- 1
end <- 5
unlist(lapply(increments, \(x) seq(start, end, x)))
  
```

In cheapr you can use `seq_()` which accepts vector arguments.

```{r}
seq_(start, end, increments)
```

Use `add_id = TRUE` to label the individual sequences.

```{r}
seq_(start, end, increments, add_id = TRUE)
```

If you know the sizes of your sequences beforehand, use `sequence_()`

```{r}
seq_sizes <- c(3, 5, 10)
sequence_(seq_sizes, from = 0, by = 1/3, add_id = TRUE) |> 
  enframe_()
```

You can also calculate the sequence sizes using `seq_size()`

```{r}
seq_size(start, end, increments)
```

## 'Cheaper' Base R alternatives

### which

```{r}
x <- rep(TRUE, 10^6)
mark(cheapr_which = which_(x),
     base_which = which(x))
x <- rep(FALSE, 10^6)
mark(cheapr_which = which_(x),
     base_which = which(x))
x <- c(rep(TRUE, 5e05), rep(FALSE, 1e06))
mark(cheapr_which = which_(x),
     base_which = which(x))
x <- c(rep(FALSE, 5e05), rep(TRUE, 1e06))
mark(cheapr_which = which_(x),
     base_which = which(x))
x <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 10^6, TRUE)
x[sample.int(10^6, 10^4)] <- NA
mark(cheapr_which = which_(x),
     base_which = which(x))
```

### factor

```{r}
x <- sample(seq(-10^3, 10^3, 0.01))
y <- do.call(paste0, expand.grid(letters, letters, letters, letters))
mark(cheapr_factor = factor_(x), 
     base_factor = factor(x))
mark(cheapr_factor = factor_(x, order = FALSE), 
     base_factor = factor(x, levels = unique(x)))
mark(cheapr_factor = factor_(y), 
     base_factor = factor(y))
mark(cheapr_factor = factor_(y, order = FALSE), 
     base_factor = factor(y, levels = unique(y)))
```

### intersect & setdiff

```{r}
x <- sample.int(10^6, 10^5, TRUE)
y <- sample.int(10^6, 10^5, TRUE)
mark(cheapr_intersect = intersect_(x, y, dups = FALSE),
     base_intersect = intersect(x, y))
mark(cheapr_setdiff = setdiff_(x, y, dups = FALSE),
     base_setdiff = setdiff(x, y))
```

### `%in_%` and `%!in_%`

```{r}
mark(cheapr = x %in_% y,
     base = x %in% y)
mark(cheapr = x %!in_% y,
     base = !x %in% y)
```

### `as_discrete`

`as_discrete` is a cheaper alternative to `cut`

```{r}
x <- rnorm(10^7)
b <- seq(0, max(x), 0.2)
mark(cheapr_cut = as_discrete(x, b, left = FALSE), 
     base_cut = cut(x, b))
```
