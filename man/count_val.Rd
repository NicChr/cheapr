\title{Count the number of occurrences of a value.}
\usage{
count_val(x, value, recursive = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector, list, data frame or matrix.}

\item{value}{A value with which to count the frequency of.}

\item{recursive}{Should the function be applied recursively to lists?}
}
\value{
A count of the number of times \code{value} appears in \code{x}.
}
\description{
This is a programmer's version of \code{sum(x == value)} to count the number of
occurrences of a value without creating a potentially large logical vector.
}
\details{
This is a generalisation of \code{num_na()} and as such the identity
\code{count_val(x, NA) == num_na(x)} will always hold.
}
